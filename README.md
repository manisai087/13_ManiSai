The problem is to build a system that automatically transforms structured financial statement data—such as income statements,
balance sheets, and cash flow tables—into a clear, sectioned Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) narrative that explains

disclosures with proper citations, producing a reliable first-draft document that is accurate, explainable, and suitable for human review.
